Django Undocumented
===================

**Work in Progress**

This project is a collection of undocumented Django "features".  These
"features" may actually be implementation details that may not work
consistently in future or older versions of Django.

Things that will be noted for each feature:

- An explanation of the feature
- Links to other sites that reference/explain the feature
- First Django version it works in (if known)
- Most recent Django version it works in (if known)

Similar projects that could be merged or referenced:

- `django model meta reference`_

The `features`_ file lists some features that should be added to this guide.

.. _features: features.rst
.. _django model meta reference: https://github.com/unbracketed/django_model_meta_reference
